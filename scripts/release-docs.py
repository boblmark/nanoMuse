    scripts/release-docs.py 0.1.40 0.1.41 Clear Still 2026-10-20

- ``CHANGELOG.md``: a ``## [<new>] - <date> · <Codename>`` heading goes right under
  ``## [Unreleased]`` so the Unreleased bullets fall under it; the empty ``### Cloud / Runtime /
  …`` headings for the next version are put back by hand (see the previous release commit).
- ``README.md``, ``docs/readme/README_*.md``, ``docs/index.md``, ``docs/zh/index.md``: ``<old> <OldName>`` becomes
  ``<new> <NewName>``, every ``v<old>`` tag and ``nanoMuse-<old>`` asset name moves to the new
  version. A *News* list (lines ``- `<date>` …``) is left as written: its lines are milestones,
  and a milestone's line keeps its date, its version and its words for good. A major version
  (``x.0.0``) is a milestone and gets a new line, written by hand and put first, in the ten
  READMEs and on the homepage's ``index.html``; a smaller release gets none, the download
  tables and the version line say what the current version is.
- ``docs/release-notes-template.md``: the new codename joins the list.
- ``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.yml``: the example versions (``1.0.0 (43)``, ``desktop 1.0.0``)
  move to the new version and the ``VERSION_CODE`` that ``scripts/rebrand.py`` carries.
- ``docs/roadmap.md`` and ``docs/zh/roadmap.md``: with ``--roadmap`` and ``--roadmap-zh`` (both
  or neither) a row ``| <new> | <NewName> | <one line> |`` goes at the end of the past-releases
  table of each; without them the row is written by hand, like the ``docs/parity.md`` cells
  that said "next release".

``--dry-run`` writes nothing and prints, for every page with a News list, its first three News
lines (unchanged by this script) so the reviewer sees what a new milestone line would go above.

Run from the repository root. ``scripts/release-bump.sh`` comes before this, ``scripts/rebrand.py``
in between; CONTRIBUTING.md has the whole recipe.
